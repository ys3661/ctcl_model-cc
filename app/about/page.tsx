            <p>
              The CTCL Risk Assessment Tool was developed to help dermatologists identify patients who may be at higher
              risk for Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL). Early diagnosis of CTCL can be challenging due to its
              resemblance to common skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis, often leading to delays in diagnosis and
              treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
              This tool uses a set of clinical indicators that have been associated with CTCL to generate a risk
              assessment. It is designed to be used by general dermatologists as an aid in clinical decision-making,
              particularly when considering whether to perform a biopsy or refer to a specialist.
            </p>
            <p>
              The risk calculator is based on clinical research and expert consensus on the most common presenting
              features of CTCL. It is intended to supplement, not replace, clinical judgment and does not provide a
              definitive diagnosis.

          </CardHeader>
          <CardContent className="space-y-4">
            <p>
              The risk assessment is calculated based on a study in the Geskin lab which created a supervised machine
              learning classifier based on a Random Forest algorithm, trained on structured clinical data extracted from
              electronic health records prior to diagnosis. This model used key binary historical variables—including
              history of multiple biopsies, failed topical steroids, other failed therapies, scaly patches or plaques,
              erythema, xerosis, pruritus, and presence of other rashes—to distinguish patients with cutaneous T-cell
              lymphoma (CTCL) from those with benign inflammatory skin conditions. Prioritizing sensitivity to minimize
              false negatives, the final model achieved an accuracy of 72%, with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity
              of 55%.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's important to note that this tool provides a risk assessment, not a diagnosis. A high-risk result
              should prompt consideration of appropriate next steps, which may include biopsy, referral to a specialist,
              or additional testing.

                The risk assessment is based on clinical features and does not incorporate histopathological,
